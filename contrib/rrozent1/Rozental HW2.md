# Change in the number of individuals on social benefits
"How has the number of individuals on social benefits changed over time, and what are the main factors driving this change?"

What are social benefits?
- unemployment benefits
- welfare payments
- disability benefits
- stimulus checks?

Hypothesis for Influential factors:
- Economic condition/ unemployment rates
- Policy changes such as the introduction of stricter/looser eligibility criteria
- Demographic changes, such as aging populations, or changes in societal attitudes towards social benefits.
- Natural disasters or pandemics, such as COVID-19


# Innovation as measured by new patents issued (scaled by something you propose)
How do patents promote innovation?
- protection of novel ideas
- encouragement of disclosure
- monetary incentives for R&D
- collaboration and licensing opportunities

"How can we measure innovation by looking at the number of new patents issued?"

Potential scales:

- Per Capita
$$
\nonumber Patent Innovation Index =\frac{Number of Patents Issued}{Population Size} 
$$
- GDP Scaling
$$
\nonumber Patent Innovation Index =\frac{Number of Patents Issued}{GDP} 
$$

- R&D Expenditure
$$
\nonumber Patent Innovation Index =\frac{Number of Patents Issued}{R n D Expenditure} 
$$

- Citation analysis: how often a patent is cited by subsequent patents indicates its importance. Ex: area with fewer, but more cited patents = more innovative than one with many rarely cited patent
$$
\nonumber Patent Innovation Index =\frac{Number of Patents Cited}{Total Patent ins Region} 
$$

- Industry-specific scaling: we can analyze innovation in a particular sector by scaling the number of patents by the revenue/size of the associated industry.


$$
\nonumber Patent Innovation Index of Sector X =\frac{Number of New Patents in Sector X}{Revenue of Industry X} 
$$
