  "title": "Innovation as measured by new patents issued.",
  "abstract": "Companies heavily invest in research and development in the current competitive environment to promote innovation, which is frequently measured by the number of patents obtained. The sheer number of patents, however, might not always be a reliable sign of ground-breaking or creative contributions to the subject. This study investigates whether businesses that acquire a greater number of patents, scaled by their R&D expenditure, necessarily yield inventions that are innovative. Two metrics will be used to assess how innovative a patent is: originality, which indicates the novelty and distinctness of the patented invention, and citation rate, which shows the impact and acknowledgment of the patent in later research. These findings are vital for businesses looking to foster true innovation and offer insights into the effectiveness of R&D investments.",
  "introduction": "In the United States alone, businesses spent $538 billion on research and development – and that was just in 2020. R&D spending has been steadily increasing (He,2018). Extensive Research and Development spending is closely correlated with an increase in Patent counts (Trajtenberg, 1990). On the surface, this looks like a good thing, however, the great variability in patents and their respective novelness means simple patent counts cannot be informative enough about innovative output (Trajtenberg, 1990). This begs the question, is this spending really paying off? Technological innovation is the main driver for economic growth, and thus spending on innovation, Research and Development is a valuable indicator of progress (Mohamed, 2022). Thus, companies have been forced to boost their R&D expenditures as they compete to innovate, frequently using patent numbers as a barometer for their inventiveness (He, 2018). Stakeholders, including competitors and investors, frequently view a company's expanding patent portfolio as evidence of its inventive strength (Griliches, 1991). But the question remains: Does a higher number of patents actually indicate higher quality or innovation, especially when measured against R&D expenditure? In order to address this, the connection between a company's total number of patents - normalized by R&D expenditure- and its actual level of innovation must be examined. Patent counts weighted by citations as indicators of the value of innovations, can overcome the limitations of simple counts (Trajtenberg, 1990). The following analysis seeks to determine if larger patent portfolios inevitably imply ground-breaking contributions to the area by employing citation rate and originality as proxy indicators.",
  "previous_works": "This issue has been previously addressed in 2001 by Bronwyn H. Hall, who examined the U.S. patent database, presenting 30 years of patenting trends and citation-based measures, while addressing challenges in interpreting citation counts (Hall, 2001). This research presents a valuable perspective on assessing the true value of patents (Hall, 2001). Professor Zhaozhao He similarly used patents in his 2018 analysis of corporate innovation - an increasingly important topic that has attracted significant attention from academic researchers in financial economics in recent years (He, 2018).",
  "concept": "Here's where the concept introduced by Trajtenberg in 1990 becomes pertinent: the idea of weighing patent counts by citations. In academic and research circles, the frequency with which a paper is cited often reflects its influence and significance. Similarly, in the patent world, the number of times a patent is cited can be a testament to its value and the innovation it represents. Therefore, instead of focusing solely on raw patent numbers, considering the number of citations each patent receives might provide a clearer picture of its innovative worth. By integrating this citation-based approach, the analysis aims to scrutinize whether possessing a vast patent arsenal necessarily translates to monumental innovations. Employing citation frequency and the degree of originality as guiding markers or proxies, this examination endeavors to discern whether there's a concrete relationship between the size of a company's patent repertoire and the depth and breadth of its contributions to its field.",
  "proposal": "Motivated by this I propose a framework of analysis for answering this question. The first criterion is narrowing down the dataset to consider patents from companies in similar industries, ensuring a level field of comparison. This helps to check that technological constraints and opportunities are uniform across the dataset (ie. The pharmaceutical industry and the tech industry would likely have different patenting trends). The four steps of this process are industry segmentation, normalization by Research and Development expenditure, an originality assessment, and a comparative Analysis. First, in analyzing Patent data, patents will be organized based on industries. Next, the number of patents issued to a company per unit of R&D expenditure will be calculated – providing a ratio of spending efficiency. Then the combination of previous patents the examined patent cited and the other patent cited by it will be examined. The last step will be to compare companies in terms of their patent numbers."
